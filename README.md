# Bingo Vs Computer

Bingo Vs Computer is an exciting and challenging web-based game where you compete against the computer to complete a 5x5 board filled with numbers from 1 to 25. The objective is to mark five blocks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line before the computer wins the match. The game combines luck and strategy as you click on the blocks to fill them, and the computer takes its turn randomly.

## About the Project

Bingo Vs Computer is an engaging web-based game that offers a classic Bingo experience with a twist. The game presents a 5x5 board with each block containing a unique number from 1 to 25. The player and the computer take turns clicking on the blocks to fill them. The objective is to be the first to complete five blocks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line before the computer wins the match.

To play, the player starts by clicking on any unclicked block on their turn. The computer then takes its turn by randomly selecting an unclicked block. The game continues in this turn-based manner until either the player or the computer successfully forms a line of five completed blocks.

Once a line is formed, the winning player declares 'BINGO!' to indicate their victory. If the computer completes the line first, the computer wins the game.

The game also prevents the player from clicking on blocks that have already been filled to maintain fair gameplay.
